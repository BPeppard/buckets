# Plugins (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Currently plugins are based on [NPM modules](https://www.npmjs.org). Plugin NPM names must take the form of `buckets-_name_`. The first example being developed is [buckets-location](http://github.com/davidkaneda/buckets-location/) which adds a Location FieldType.

Hereâ€™s the basic client API so far (some of this is just conceptual for now):

```
bkts.plugin('plugin_slug', {
  name: 'Plugin Name'
  config: // Underscore template (as a string) or Backbone/Chaplin View (you can require a class as well)
  input: // Underscore template (as a string) or Backbone/Chaplin View (you can require a class as well)
});
```

`bkts` is exposed to plugins as a global object, and is actually the `Application` instance of the running Buckets.

### CoffeeScript Support

By default, because plugin code is either built into JavaScript or run live on the server, CoffeeScript is supported (but optional).

### CommonJS Support

JavaScript or CoffeeScript files in your plugin have access to a `require` function. On the client-side, files are grouped together using browserify as they are built to be included in the app. This way, we can have simple "manifest" files for the plugin both client and server-side (in `client.js` and `server.js`), and those manifests can import any NPM modules.

Handlebars template paths (`.hbs`) can be `require`d as well.
