# What's a slug?


A slug is simply a human-friendly ID for an objectâ€”whether a Bucket or an Entry. Slugs are typically lowercase, have no spaces or special punctuation. Slugs are often used in URLs and Templates. In Buckets, all slugs are generated automatically as a user types a title, though they can be customized as well.

For example, if you create an entry titled, "Apple & Google," the corresponding slug would automatically be set to: "apple-and-google."
